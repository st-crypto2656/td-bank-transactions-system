# simple-bank-transactions-system
Console-based banking system built in C++
This program collects user information and simulates basic banking operations, including
depositing, withdrawing, displaying updated account details, and exiting the system.
After a user completes their session, the screen is cleared and the program accepts input
from the next user. The system supports up to 10 users, as specified in the program
requirements.
